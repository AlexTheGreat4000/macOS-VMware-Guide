Congratulations, you've just made a macOS VM. See, it wasn't so bad after all. You may have noticed that your keyboard and mouse isn't working. Don't worry, it fixes itself after about 2 minutes of leaving the machine idle. This issue happens on bootup and there is currently no fix for this. Do not ask when it will be fixed, the page will get updated when there is a fix and I will post about it on the AMD OS X discord.
