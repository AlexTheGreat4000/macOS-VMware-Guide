# Prerequisites

What you are going to need:

* [VMware Player 15](https://www.vmware.com/au/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)/Workstation Pro 15 \(Note: I'm only providing a download for VMware Player which is free for personal use. VMware Workstation Pro is paid and requires a license key. For legal reasons, I'm not providing a download/license key for VMware Workstation. However, either of them will work for this guide.\)
* [VMware Unlocker](https://github.com/DrDonk/unlocker/releases) \(this will allow you to install macOS in VMware in a more native way, this also contains our bootloader that we'll be using.\)
* [A VMware AMD macOS installer](http://files.sydneyerickson.uk/MojaveAMD.vmdk) \(10.14.1\)
